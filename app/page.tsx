          <h2 className="title_2"> What is Tuberculosis (TB)</h2>
          <p className="p_1">
            Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium called
            Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rarely by Mycobacterium bovis. These
            bacteria live inside human cells, mainly in the lungs. TB has many
            symptoms like cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever,
            sweating, weight loss etc. After infection, some people develop TB
            quite quickly, while in others the bacteria remain inactive for many
            years. This difference is because of the difference in immunity
            between individuals.

          <h2 className="title_2"> TB transmission</h2>
          <p className="p_1">
            TB bacteria can enter the lungs in airborne droplets. It spread when
            infected people with the active form of the illness cough, sneeze or
            talks. The bacteria are carried in the air in tiny droplets of
            liquid. Transmission occurs when people who are uninfected inhale
            (breath in) the droplets. These happen rapidly in places where many
            people are living in crowded conditions such as crowded public
            transportation, crowded living conditions.
          </p>
          <p className="p_1">
            The other transmission way is by consuming undercooked meat and
            unpasteurized milk. This type of transmission mainly occurs for the
            TB transmitted from infected animals.
          </p>
          <p className="p_1">
            Tuberculosis can be Drug Resistant type because of in adequate TB
            treatment which could be due to missed medications, taking
            suboptimal doses, or living or contact with individuals infected by
            the resistant bacteria.
